				<p class="detais">Michael Jackson (1958–2009) debuted on the professional music scene at age five as a
					member of the American family music group The Jackson 5 and began a solo career in 1971 while still
					part of the group. Jackson promoted seven of his solo albums with music videos or, as he would refer
					to them, "short films". Some of them drew criticism for their violent and sexual elements; others
					were lauded by critics and awarded Guinness World Records for their length, success, and cost. In
					the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular culture and the first African-American
					entertainer to have a strong crossover fanbase on MTV. The popularity of his music videos that aired
					on MTV such as "Billie Jean", "Beat It" and "Thriller"—credited for transforming the music video
					from a promotional tool into an art form—helped bring fame to the relatively new channel. The
					success of these music videos helped shift MTV's focus from its original "rock 'n' roll only" format
					to pop and R&B and saved the channel from financial ruin. Michael Jackson's Thriller short film
					marked a growth in scale for music videos and has been named the most successful music video ever by
					the Guinness World Records. The 18-minute music video for "Bad", directed by Martin Scorsese,
					depicts Jackson and Wesley Snipes as members of an inner-city gang. Jackson paid cinematic tribute
					to West Side Story with the choreography. For the "Smooth Criminal" video, Jackson experimented with
					an anti-gravity lean, in which the performer leans forward at a 45-degree angle, beyond their center
					of gravity.<br><a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson_videography"

				<p class="detais">The Jackson 5 are an American music group, formed in 1964 by the Jackson family
					brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael. The brothers first invitation to perform was
					in Glen Park in 1965, with other early concerts at Theodore Roosevelt College and Career Academy,
					Gilroy Stadium, Gary’s Memorial Auditorium, Regal Theater, Chicago and Apollo Theater, Harlem in
					1967.
					The quintet's first concert tour was in the United States, where they performed in cities such as
					Boston, Cincinnati and New York City throughout the final quarter of 1970. The brothers remained in
					their homeland for two more US tours, before successfully expanding to Europe in 1971 and the rest
					of world the following year. Following a move from Motown to Epic Records, the group was renamed The
					Jacksons, and embarked on another tour of Europe, where they performed in front of Queen Elizabeth
					II. After their interim concert series in 1978, the siblings proceeded with the Destiny Tour, a
					promotional platform for their similarly named album. Their 1981 36-city circulation of the United
					States—the Triumph Tour—came next. The Jacksons' final tour together was in 1984, following the
					release of two albums: the band's Victory and Michael Jackson's Thriller. The Victory Tour spanned
					55 performances in the United States and Canada and grossed over $75 million. Having toured with his
					brothers since the early 1970s, Michael Jackson began his first solo world tour on September 12,
					1987, in Tokyo, Japan. Attracting over 4 million people, including royalty, the Bad Tour proved to
					be successful, becoming the most-highly attended and highest-earning tour of all time. The follow-up
					concert series—the Dangerous World Tour of 1992–1993—was also attended by millions. In 1996, Jackson
					returned with the HIStory World Tour, an 82 run of concerts that concluded the following year. The
					tour was attended by more than 4.5 million fans.<br><a id="tribute-link"
